In this is post, I'll give a quick overview of the new features in the new
release of [RiotSharp](https://github.com/BenFradet/RiotSharp), the C# wrapper
for [the Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/).

### New Tournament API

In this release, we've added support to the new Tournament API which was
announced by Riot [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/discussion/announcements/show/72Ajd1An)
a month ago. Thanks to this addition, given that you've applied for a special
tournament API key, you'll be able to build a tournament system with the given
features:

  - Generate as many tournaments and tournament codes as you need
  - Automatic return of results to an HTTP endpoint of your choice, with
fail/retry error checking
  - Pre-game lobby events: who joined, who left, who switched teams and when
champ select, the loading screen, and the game itself begin
  - Match results via the match endpoint, even though they are not ranked


I'll give a quick rundown on how to do that.

First, you'll need a tournament API instance, which you can retrieve with the
tournament API key you got:
{% highlight c# %}
var tournamentApi = TournamentRiotApi.GetInstance("TOURNAMENT_API_KEY");
{% endhighlight %}

Then, you will have to create a provider given the region where the tournament
will take place and the url to an HTTP server listening on port 80 to which Riot
Games' servers will send callbacks containing information about completed games
created with a tournament code you generated, more on that later:
{% highlight c# %}
var provider = tournamentApi.CreateProvider(Region.euw, "http://website.com");
{% endhighlight %}

Thanks to this provider, which you should save if you want to create other
tournaments later on, you can create tournaments:
{% highlight c# %}
var tournament = tournamentApi.CreateTournament(provider.Id, "TOURNAMENT_NAME");
{% endhighlight %}

You can now generate tournament codes which can be used to join a game
with the specified settings:
{% highlight c# %}
var tournamentCodes = tournamentApi.CreateTournamentCodes(
    tournament.Id, teamSize, allowedSummonerIds,
    TournamentSpectatorType.All,
    TournamentPickType.TournamentDraft,
    TournamentMapType.SummonersRift,
    string.empty,
    count = 10);
{% endhighlight %}

Where you can specify:

  - the size of each team through `teamSize`
  - the ids of the summoner allowed in the game through `allowedSummonerIds`
  - the type of allowed spectating (you can choose from `None`, `Lobby` and `All`)
  - the game's pick type (`BlindPick`, `DraftMode`, `AllRandom` and `TournamentDraft`)
  - the game's map (`SummonersRift`, `TwistedTreeline`, `CrystalScar` and `HowlingAbyss`)
  - metadata in the form of a string
  - the number of tournament codes you wish to create

If you need to change some of these info, you can do so with
`UpdateTournamentCode()`. You can also retrieve these info and some more through
`GetTournamentCodeDetails()`.

Next up, you can retrieve lobby events as they are taking place!
{% highlight c# %}
var lobbyEvents = tournamentApi.GetTournamentLobbyEvents(tournamentCode);
var summonerIdsWhoJoined = lobbyEvents
    .Where(le => le.EventType == "PlayerJoinedGameEvent")
    .Select(le => le.SummonerId);
foreach (var summonerId in summonerIdsWhoJoined)
{
    Console.WriteLine(summonerId);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here, I just retrieve the summoner id of every player who joined the lobby.

Finally, unranked matches! You're now gonna be able to retrieve information
regarding a match for which the specified tournament code was used:
{% highlight c# %}
var match = tournamentApi.GetTournamentMatch(Region.euw, tournamentCode);
foreach (var participantIdentity in match.ParticipantIdentities)
{
    Console.WriteLine(participantIdentity.Player.SummonerName);
}
{% endhighlight %}

As shown, you can retrieve the same data as you would do with the standard API.
However, the tournament API does not anonymize summoner data, conversely to the
standard endpoint.

You can find a list of all supported operation in
[ITournamentRiotApi](https://github.com/BenFradet/RiotSharp/blob/develop/RiotSharp/ITournamentRiotApi.cs)
which contains all supported operations as well as their async versions.

You can find the full documentation for this API on
[developer.riotgames.com](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/tournaments-api).

### Misc

RiotSharp is now a PCL which means you will be able to use it in your Windows
Store and Windows Phone endeavors.

We've upgraded to the latest release of
[Json.NET](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json): 8.0.1.

We are now better integrated with [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) our
continous integration service: the unit tests are being run on every push to the
`develop` branch. Unfortunately, the tests cannot be run on PRs because the
API keys, which are needed to run the tests, are stored as encrypted environment
variables which are not enabled by AppVeyor when building PRs.

### Contribute!

RiotSharp is now on [up-for-grabs](http://up-for-grabs.net/#/) and there are
[quite a few easy-to-solve issues](https://github.com/BenFradet/RiotSharp/labels/up-for-grabs)
for you to contribute. So feel free to jump right in!
